# Developers' Guide

This is the GitHub Repository for Developers' Guide. You can find all the free resources you need to get started with programming or build upon new skills all in one place. The resources are classified categorically. 

## Introduction

The amount of free resources that we can find today on the internet is often overwhelming to those willing to explore. On the contrary, a lot of people are unware of the existence of most of these resources due to lack of interest in thorough research. Hence, I would be categorically posting new resources everyday (can be a delayed sometimes). This would help you all eliminate the need to repeatedly search for material to study from.

### Practice Coding 
| Coding Practice Websites | Description 
---------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 [Hackerrank](https://www.hackerrank.com/dashboard)| HackerRank is a place where programmers from all over the world come together to solve problems in a wide range of Computer Science domains such as algorithms, machine learning, or artificial intelligence, as well as to practice different programming paradigms like functional programming.
 [Code Chef](https://www.codechef.com/) | CodeChef is an online competitive platform for coding, which helps you to improve your coding skills. At CodeChef, you can both practice and compete. In practice section , you can make your coding skills sharp by going through "easy", "beginner", and other sub-sections of practice.
[Top Coder](https://www.topcoder.com/challenges/) | Topcoder is a algorithm competitive programming and software crowdsourcing website. Competitive programming is a sport where participants try to solve algorithmic (step by step instructions to bring output from input based on a situation) problems as fast as possible to get a rank. Faster you code better your rank.
[Codin Game](https://www.codingame.com/start) | For software engineers who have some coding experience and are looking to advance their skills, CodinGame is a good source. The challenges are CodinGame are not for beginners as they require some background knowledge before you can participate.
[GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/) | A portal and forum for computer science interview questions and technical articles
[Coder Byte](https://coderbyte.com/challenges) | Coderbyte is an online collection of coding challenges in 10 different languages, which can be solved directly in their online editor. The challenges come with official solutions and tens of thousands of user solutions. Users can move up through the ranks by solving challenges with good scores.
[Top Coder](https://www.topcoder.com/challenges/?pageIndex=1) | Topcoder is a algorithm competitive programming and software crowdsourcing website. Competitive programming is a sport where participants try to solve algorithmic (step by step instructions to bring output from input based on a situation) problems as fast as possible to get a rank. Faster you code better your rank.
[Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/about) | Project Euler is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that will require more than just mathematical insights to solve. Although mathematics will help you arrive at elegant and efficient methods, the use of a computer and programming skills will be required to solve most problems.
[Code Signal](https://app.codesignal.com/arcade) | CodeSignal is a skills-based assessment platform operated by American company BrainFights, Inc., whose mission is to discover, develop and promote technical talent.
[Code Wars](https://www.codewars.com/dashboard) | Codewars is an educational community for computer programming. On the platform, software developers train on programming challenges known as kata. These discrete programming exercises train a range of skills in a variety of programming languages, and are completed within an online integrated development environment.
[Leet Code](https://leetcode.com/) |  It's a website where people–mostly software engineers–practice their coding skills. There are 800+ questions (and growing), each with multiple solutions. Questions are ranked by level of difficulty: easy, medium, and hard. Similar websites include HackerRank, Topcoder, InterviewBit, among others.
[Challenge Rocket](https://challengerocket.com/hackathons-and-challenges.html) | ChallengeRocket is a platform to run online tech challenges and creatives hackathons. It's a great way for brands worldwide to: run employer branding, discover new candidates for tech positions and assess programming talents.
[Code Forces](https://codeforces.com/) | Codeforces is a competitve programming website. Contests are regularly hosted here. Competitive coding enthusiasts from all over the world participate in these contests.It also contains a rich set of problems from previous contests which are awesome to improve ones algorithm skills.
